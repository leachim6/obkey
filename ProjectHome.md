ObKey is the Openbox Key Editor, written in Python + PyGTK.

The latest version is 1.0 (looks stable). Development is halted.

PyGTK 2.14 is **REQUIRED**

## Usage ##
Simply unpack it (or clone git repo) and run as the python script, by default it uses ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml as a config file containing keyboard setup.
```
./obkey
```
But also you can specify other config file:
```
./obkey mycustomrc.xml
```

You can get the latest git version here:

Also there is a screencast, maybe a little boring (about 6-7 megs, swf):
